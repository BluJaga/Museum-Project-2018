				<td>Grace Banker</td>
				<td>Chief Operator of the US Signal Corps telephone operators. Acted as the operator for longer-distance communication during the war, and led the other women in taking calls filled with English, French, and all kinds of codes. Despite trying conditions, her work, along with the other women operators, were able to ensure the success of telephones and communication during World War I.</td>

				<td>Emmett Scott</td>
				<td>Special Adviser of Black Affairs to the Secretary of War. Organized a meeting between African-American journalists on reporting on black soldiers. He fought for the rights of African-Americans to be treated equally in the military, and ended up writing a book on the history of African-Americans in World War I. He was the highest-ranking African-American in the Wilson Administration, and his efforts to obtain racial equality in the military will be commended in our museum.</td>

				<td>Treaty of Versailles</td>
				<td>The Captain of the USS Maine. He was going about his business as per usual when he heard the explosions, and assembled a team for damage-control. Took the side that a Spanish Mine had sunk the Maine, and provided his opinion on the matter to journalists. Helped to spark headlines that caused public opinion against Spain, with the cry of “REMEMBER THE MAINE.”</td>

				<td><img src="photos/unit3/wilson.png" height="150" width="100" alt="Wilson"></td>
				<td>Woodrow Wilson</td>
				<td>The treaty that officially ended World War I. Established the League of Nations, the first major attempt at creating a sort of council of world leaders to maintain peace. Took much away from Germany, including land and military, as well as blamed Germany for the entire war. It would be much of these damages that would snowball into the causes of World War II. As well, this treaty did not give Italy the land it was promised in 1915, which lead them to side with Germany and Japan in World War II. Overall, much of the solutions present in this treaty were temporary and ended up causing future conflict.</td>
